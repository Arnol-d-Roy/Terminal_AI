# 🎮 Interactive Tutorial Demo

## Try It Now!

This is a quick demo to show you how the interactive system works.

### Demo Checklist

Check these boxes to see how it works:

#### Demo Tasks (Try clicking these in VS Code preview!)
- [ ] Read this demo file (+5 XP)
- [ ] Open PROGRESS-TRACKER.md in VS Code (+5 XP)
- [ ] Click a checkbox in preview mode (+10 XP)
- [ ] Run `python3 xp-calculator.py` (+10 XP)
- [ ] Start Level 1 of the tutorial (+5 XP)

**Demo XP: ___ / 35**

### How to Test

1. **Open this file in VS Code**
   ```bash
   code DEMO.md
   ```

2. **Enable Preview Mode**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac)

3. **Click the checkboxes above**
   - Watch them toggle from `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - The file saves automatically

4. **See the magic!**
   - Switch back to editor view

### What Makes This Interactive?

The checkboxes use **GitHub-flavored Markdown** syntax:
- `- [ ]` = Unchecked
- `- [x]` = Checked

Modern markdown viewers (VS Code, GitHub, Obsidian, etc.) make these clickable!

### Now Try the Real Thing!

1. Open `PROGRESS-TRACKER.md`
2. Check off tasks as you complete them
3. Run `python3 xp-calculator.py` to see your stats
4. Watch your level grow! 🚀
